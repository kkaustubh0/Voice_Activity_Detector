## Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a signal processing technique used to detect the presence or absence of human speech in an audio signal. It plays a crucial role in various applications such as speech processing, audio coding, and voice communication systems.

### Implementation

This repository includes an Energy-based VAD module implemented in Python. The VAD module is capable of detecting speech segments within an audio signal based on the energy of the signal. It utilizes the concept of short-time energy to determine whether a given frame contains speech or silence.

The VAD module can be easily implemented in Python projects using the provided code. It takes an audio waveform as input and returns a boolean array indicating the presence of speech in each frame of the audio.

### Usage

To use the VAD module, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, including `numpy` and `scipy`.

2. Import the `EnergyVAD` class from the `vad` module.

3. Create an instance of the `EnergyVAD` class with the desired parameters such as sample rate, frame length, frame shift, and energy threshold.

4. Apply the VAD instance to the audio waveform to detect speech segments.

5. Optionally, use the VAD instance to extract speech segments from the audio waveform.

### Applications

Voice Activity Detection has numerous applications across various domains:

- **Speech Processing**: VAD is used to segment speech signals for tasks such as speech recognition, speaker diarization, and speech synthesis.

- **Audio Coding**: In audio compression algorithms such as MPEG audio coding, VAD is employed to reduce the bit rate by excluding silent or non-speech segments.

- **Voice Communication Systems**: VAD is utilized in VoIP systems, video conferencing applications, and telecommunication systems to optimize bandwidth usage and improve overall efficiency.

- **Noise Reduction**: VAD can be used in noise reduction algorithms to distinguish between speech and background noise, enabling effective noise suppression techniques.

- **Voice Activity Monitoring**: VAD is used in applications where monitoring voice activity is important, such as surveillance systems, call center analytics, and voice-controlled devices.
